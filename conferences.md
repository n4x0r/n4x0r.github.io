<h2> - r2Con2016 Glibc Heap Analysis with radare2 </h2>
<h4>Even though the functionality of the Heap is well known among Reverse Engineers and Exploit Developers, generally the internal mechanisms of this memory region are unknown due to the poor documentation and complexity of the different dynamic memory allocators and their differences across systems. For that reason, this talk is intended to familiarize the audience with the Linux Heap structure formed by the glibc malloc dynamic memory allocator algorithm along with its analysis using radare2.</h4>
