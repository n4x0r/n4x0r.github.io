<h2> - Virus Bulletin 2020: Ramsay. A cyber-espionage toolkit tailored for air-gapped networks</h2>
<h4> In March 2020 at ESET we discovered a cyber-espionage toolkit we call Ramsay, specifically designed to steal documents and operate within air-gapped networks with ties to DarkHotel APT. This presentation covers the core findings of our investigation, giving an overview of Ramsay's main capabilities, operation and links found to DarkHotel.â€¯

<h2> - r2Con2019: ELF Crafting. Uncovering Advance Anti-analysis techniques for the Linux Platform. </h2>
<h4>This talk will not be based on common Linux Malware but on advanced anti-analysis techniques that could make Linux Malware harder to analyse as a rise of awareness attempt of modern Linux Threats.
Linux Malware is becoming more complex as newer Linux dominated ecosystems rise in today's IT landscape.
There is not much visibility of the Linux Threat Landscape and its capabilities. Recently, the security community has experienced a rise of awareness of Linux Threats as more malware is being found on this platform.

<h2> - Virus Bulletin 2019: Exploring The Chinese DDoS Ecosystem </h2>
<h4>During this presentation, Intezer researcher Nacho Sanmillan will provide an overview of the Chinese DDoS landscape and discuss the current state of ChinaZ, a threat actor group notorious for targeting Windows and Linux systems with botnets since November 2014. He will also provide context into Nitol, a malware family with alleged Chinese origins and a prominent player in the DDoS ecosystem. Nacho will present the various methods employed to discover ChinaZ and Nitol's servers and analyse code reuse relationships with groups such as MrBlack and Iron Tiger APT.</h4>

<h2> - r2Con2016: Glibc Heap Analysis with radare2 </h2>
<h4>Even though the functionality of the Heap is well known among Reverse Engineers and Exploit Developers, generally the internal mechanisms of this memory region are unknown due to the poor documentation and complexity of the different dynamic memory allocators and their differences across systems. For that reason, this talk is intended to familiarize the audience with the Linux Heap structure formed by the glibc malloc dynamic memory allocator algorithm along with its analysis using radare2.</h4>
