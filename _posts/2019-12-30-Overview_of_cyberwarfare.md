This article is meant to be a brief reference of the different states involved in Cyber Warfare and their capabilities. However, in order to understand the information provided the right way, is essential that we cover some base knowledge around Cyber Warfare first. A great reference is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvS4efEakpY&list=PLxA6YRnSzNvINyHpEL5tkDzpu_fKBAXGR&index=1https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvS4efEakpY&list=PLxA6YRnSzNvINyHpEL5tkDzpu_fKBAXGR&index=1) presentation by The Grugq, which is the main reference among other sources where some of the more theoritical information that will be presented is based on. 

<br/>

## **Foundation**  
Is important to interpret Cyber Warfare as the fifth War dimension. Is important to recognise this and the ways these dimensions intersects with reality. Cyber intersects with reality in four different ways. These are the following:

* **Active** - Direct way of manipulatinig target's information - eg: Unit8200 was fighting with the PLO. They broke into the computers were the PL0 processed all the finances and they transfered money around to make it appear as if there was deep corruption. This strategy worked because there was a degree of real corruption. So this operation spiked the corruption awareness of the [PLO](https://www.ft.com/content/1b870488-7940-11d9-89c5-00000e2511c8). This caused a degree of degradation of capability within the PLO. 

* **Passive** - Ability to monitor target's information - Some states are heavily relying on this intersection. eg: Snowden [Leaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)) NSA's secret global surveilance program to the public.

* **Physical** - Direct impact on physical targets - eg: Operation Olympic Games or also known as [Stuxnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet), was deployed to cause substantial damage to Iran's nuclear program by compromising PLCs in Iranian Uranium enrichment facilities, collecting information on industrial systems and causing the fast-spinning centrifuges to tear themselves apart.

* **Cognitive** - Ability to modify a target's behavior with information - Based on the same foundations as Marketing or Propaganda. Not restricted to distribution of untruthful information or disiniformation, sometimes a target's behavior can be changed by supplying unknown truths. I highly suggest to read about Reflexive Control Theory to know more about the stategies that can be applied in this specific intersection.

Based on these intersections we can build a high level theoritical overview of the capabilities and realistic outcomes of what can be achieved relying on operations in the Cyber domain.

<br/>

## **Teams**  
Cyber Warfare is not really about computers, is more about people and information. Cyber operations are operated via private and public sector companies, with managers, salaries, budget etc, etc ...

Is important to understand that based on these environments, burocracy is a major factor which enables the capacity of cyber operations in a number of different ways. Burocracy enables teams to work at maximum capacity making it fundamental for any type of cyber operation. 

Based on burocracy we can meassure the efficiency of a team's capacity on a series of characteristics. We can call these characteristics the Factors of Team Capacity.

### **Factors of Team Capacity**  
* **Addaptability** - How well a team can adapt newer technologies to be utilized and aligned with an ultimate outcome on cyber conflict.

* **Agility** - How rapid a team can change an operational approach to achieve a common goal.

* **Speed** - How fast a team can leverage an idea from an execution. Usually a measure of burocracy flexibility.

* **Creativity** - How well a team comes up with newer innovative techniques.

* **Cohesion** - How well a team works together individually and collectivelly with other teams and how good they follow the executive order.

The previous factors serve as a good standard to measure a given team's efficiency. Likely important is to know that there are a series of standard strategies to organise teams dedicated to conduct cyber operations. The following table shows these strategies also known as Dave Aitel's (former NSA cyber-operative) Meta - operational team structures: 

<br/>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="https://github.com/ulexec/ulexec.github.io/raw/master/images/dave_aitel_meta.png" /></div>
<br/>

Knowing this information will help interpreting the capabilities and the reasons behind the team structures and rate of success or failure of the various cyber operations of the 
following states.

## **Russia** ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º
The Russian Federation existance started with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. This was the process of internal disintegration within the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), also referred to as the Soviet Union, which began in the second half of the 1980s with growing unrest in the national republics and ended on 26 December 1991.

#### **Intelligence Agencies involved in Cyber Warfare:**
*   [FSB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Security_Service) - The FSB, which Putin briefly ran prior to becoming president, is often described as the main successor agency to the Soviet KGB. Established in 1995, the FSB handles domestic security, cyber security, information operations, and counterterrorism efforts, and, according to a report by the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, is the most powerful Russian intelligence agency. The FSB has three main objectives, namely countering foreign intelligence services, combatting organized crime, and ensuring economic and financial security.

*   [GRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRU_(G.U.)) - The Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. The GRU per se (under this name) was established by Joseph Stalinâ€²s order of 16 February 1942. The GRU, which dates back to the Soviet era, is the Russian military intelligence agency. In concert with its civilian counterpart, the SVR, the GRU handles external intelligence gathering and operates human intelligence officers. Additionally, it provides military intelligence for the Russian government and oversees Russian special forces (Spetsnaz).

*   [SVR](https://themoscowproject.org/explainers/russias-three-intelligence-agencies-explained/) - The SVR, like the FSB, is considered a successor to the Soviet-era KGB and is perhaps the Russian intelligence agency with the lowest profile. Headed by Sergey Naryshkin, the SVR is the civilian counterpart to the GRU, and the two agencies are similar in their responsibilities. Like the GRU, the SVR handles external intelligence gathering and operates human intelligence officers, both under diplomatic cover and as covert officers. More generally, it focuses on collecting intelligence, conducting espionage, implementing active measures, and performing electronic surveillance in foreign countries.

It's immportant to highlight that these Agencies are in constant state of rivalry. 

*'These agencies have been Historically compeating. Stalin was terrified that there was going to be a political cue run by the KGB while in times of the Soviet Union, so he made a Military Intelligence Agency (GRU) with the idea to make these agencies compete to prevent the formation of a political cue run by the Intelligence Community that would take over.'* - The Grugq (paraphrased).

This rilvalry obviously benefits the state in terms of the outcome of their cyber operations, since the high level of competition has a direct impact on operational performance.

<br/>

#### **Remarkable Cyber Operations**:
Among the different cyber operations conducted by The Russian Federation, we can highlight the following ones:

*   Cuckooâ€™s Egg 
*   Moonlight Maze
*   Attacks Against Ukranian Power Grid
*   Attack to the Democratic National Convention (DNC)

#### Approach on Cyber Warfare:
*   Acquire intelligence on foreign military projects
*   Comprommise critical infrastructure under fake persona to avoid direct attribution
*   Application of Hybrid Warfare - combining military and non-military as well as covert and overt means, including disinformation, cyber-attacks, economic pressure, deployment of irregular armed groups and use of regular forces to blur the lines between war and peace, and attempt to sow doubt in the minds of targets.
*   Active measures - Actions of political warfare designed to change the course of world events by influence operations based on disinformation campaigns producing a "politically correct" assessment of it.
*   Apply Reflexive Control Theory to influence rival states on their decision making capabilities so that the outcome reflexion is aligned with the main goals of the state while the adversary often is not aware of it.
